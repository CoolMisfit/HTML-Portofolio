<h3>Star Wars - Episodes IV-VI</h3>
<p>
  One of the best Sci-Fi movies ever to be made. Looking past it's Sci-Fi
  nature, the movie demonstrats the innate power of goddness and love.
</p>
<h3>Groundhog Day</h3>
<p>
  Some people might find this film silly, but it shows that you can be the best version
  of your self if you tried hard, and that the way to achieve that goal is by breaking
  throught your bad habits and emotional blockages the have been building up in
  your psyche
</p>
<h3>Dune</h3>
<p>Never underestimate your enemy's belief and their will to survive</p>
